![](./visuals/DKGame.jpg)  

This Github-repo holds materials for the workshop held at the Born-Digital Collections, Archives and Memory conference at London's School of Advanced Study, 2025. The workshop is centered around the Royal Danish Library's collection of video games collected under the Danish Legal Deposit Act. The workshop focuses on the work of collecting, preserving, and making the video games collection accessible to users, currently in the form of a catalogue. The workshop also includes a practical code-based data processing exercise working on the Registry of Danish Games, where attendees will extract text-based trends and development in platforms, publishers and titles from 30 years of Danish game history.
